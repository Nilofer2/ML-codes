Error Correction:
Deceits the error and finds the location of error. Once we find it, we can flip it.

Hamming code:
detects and corrects Single bit errors only.
If the receiver can correct the error = its more efficient.
Detecting the error is easy but finding the location is difficult.

Bits =m
Redundancy =k
Total message sent=m+k
The value of k must satisfy the condition 2^k>=m+k+1. 
For successful transmission m+k+1 bits must be at the receiver.
The redundancy bits are added after the data .- error detection.
The redundancy bits will be embedded in the data.- in error correction.

If k=4 then in the data the powers of 2 till the value of k I.e., 2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3 (this is the bit count, the position). 

Bit position should start with 1 always and not 0. 

Convert the bit position into binary, r1=xxx1-r2=xx1x-r3=x1xx-r4=1xxx. 

At the receiver side the repeat the same process and look for the bits of the redundancy and perform the XOR operation.
